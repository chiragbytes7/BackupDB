BackupDB | Python, C, mySQL, MongoDB
 ∗ Developed a parametrized command line utility with DB authentication for database migration written in C and python
 ∗ Allows for full database backups and supports multiple compression techniques like Zstd and Snappy to reduce overhead
 ∗ Achieved upto 67% compression with Zstd and about 2x faster backup time and about 30-50% compression and 1.5x faster backup times with Snappy
 ∗ Implemented an ETL pipeline to extract data from mySQL and MongoDB and transform them using some compression techniques and load them into a backup Database or a data lake
 ∗ Allows users to automate backups using Cron jobs
